# Twenor: Music & Audio Platform Concept

Welcome to Twenor! This document provides an overview of our conceptual platform designed to support artists with tools for audio classification, cover art creation, and more. Although Twenor is still in the conceptual phase, we are excited to share our vision for a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance your music production and management workflow.

## Concept Overview

Twenor is envisioned as a platform that offers:

1. **Neural Network-Based Audio Classification**: Automatically categorize and organize audio files using machine learning.
2. **Cover Art Creation**: Design professional cover art for your audio files with customizable tools.
3. **Recordbox XML Integration**: Load and utilize Recordbox XML data to enhance your music management.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Audio Classification**: Leverage a neural network to classify audio files based on learned patterns.
- **Cover Art Generator**: Create and customize cover art with user-friendly design tools.
- **Recordbox XML Support**: Integrate and manage music data from Recordbox XML files.

## Current State

### Conceptual Overview

Twenor is in the early conceptual phase. The core components of the platform include:

- **Grafik**: The conceptual design and architecture of Twenor.
- **Audio Lib**: A library concept for managing and classifying audio files.
- **Wave Classification Server**: A proposed Python server to extract features from audio files, store them in a database, and train a neural network for classification.

## Usage Scenarios

### Audio Classification

Upload audio files to classify them using our envisioned neural network, which will organize them based on learned patterns.

### Cover Art Creation

Design and generate professional cover art for your audio files using our proposed tools.

### Recordbox XML Integration

Import and use Recordbox XML data to manage and utilize your music assets effectively.
